# Computer  Shop | [DEMO](https://computershop-frontend.onrender.com/)

A full-featured _online shopping application_, that captures the usual flow of _user registration/login_, choosing products and _adding to cart_, and finally _checking out_ the order with personal details.

This project is written entirely with **TypeScript**, with best practices in mind leveraging **Redux Toolkit** and custom _typed hooks_ and an _expressive project structure_.
